Your SOP doesn't have 2 paragraphs, why this professor? Why this uni?

I would suggest you to read some of the SOPs first, learn how to make a paragraph on one topic and then again craft a good SOP

This is fine for a first draft, but it lacks structure. 
These are some of the resources:

https://www.openessays.org/?type=PHD&page=3

https://writeivy.com/structure-is-magic-a-guide-to-the-graduate-sop/

Read them and get an idea about how the connection between you and the University/professor/US/research/degree is more important than your independent story and narrative.
